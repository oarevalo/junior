= Junior 

Junior was inspired by Ruby's Sinatra in an attempt "for quicky creating web-applications in [ColdFusion] with minimal effort":

  # myapp.cfm
  <cfimport taglib="junior/tags" prefix="jr" />
  <jr:get url="/">
    Hello, world!
  </jr:get>

== Routes

In Junior, a route is a custom tag named after an HTTP method with a URL attribute used as a matching pattern.

  <jr:get url="/">
    .. show something ..
  </jr:get>
  
  <jr:post url="/">
    .. create something ..
  </jr:post>
  
  <jr:put url="/">
    .. update something ..
  </jr:put>
  
  <jr:delete url="/">
    .. annihilate something ..
  </jr:delete>

Routes are matched in the order they are defined. The first route that
matches the request is invoked.
